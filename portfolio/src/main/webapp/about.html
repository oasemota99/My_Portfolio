        <p class="intro">Hi! My name is Olivia Asemota. I'm a junior at Xavier University of Louisiana
            completing a double major in computer science and philosophy
            with a minor in political science. I'm from Tennessse and I have two brothers, one older and one younger.
            I have one pet, a dog named Louie who we adopted two years ago. For fun I practice the guitar, read, 
            play video games, and watch tv shows on Netflix and Hulu. A fun fact about me is that I'm a professional violist!
            I've been playing the viola for about 12 years now and I'm in a quartet that often plays events around my city. 
            Nice to meet you!</p>
